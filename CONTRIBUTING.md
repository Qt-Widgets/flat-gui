# How to contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and each of them **does matter**.

## Become a user

FlatGUI can be downloaded and used free of charge, so the best way to contribute to the project is to use it.

## Discuss issues

If you find a bug, want a specific feature, or have a question about the library, please file a [new issue](https://github.com/scopchanov/flat-gui/issues/new). 

- For bug reports, I would be glad if you could include a [Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
- For feature requests, please describe the use case, leaving as little room for assumptions as possible.
- For generic questions, please follow the Stack overflow's guidelines about [How to ask](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## Suggest improvements

FlatGUI is an open-source project, and the code has a permissive MIT license. Thereby, I highly encourage you to clone the repository and analyze how the code works. Feel free to change the code in any way you need. Although not required by the license, it would be nice of you if you could contribute the improvements you have made.

## Give a star

If you like the project, please give the repository a star, as it would motivate me to maintain this project further.
