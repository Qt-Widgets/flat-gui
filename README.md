# FlatGUI

FlatGUI is an open-source library created to support the development of non-native looking graphical user interfaces for Qt widgets-based desktop applications. It servers as an extension to the Qtâ€™s functionality, providing a component development kit (CDK) for the creation of custom widgets, as well as a collection of ready-to-use components.

1. What does this project do?

The FlatGUI library consists of Qt5 based C++ classes 
providing custom widgets for the creation of graphical 
user interfaces.

2. Why is this project useful?

The FlatGUI library allows Qt5 programmers to build elegant 
graphical user interfaces for desktop applications in C++
without the need of using technologies other than widgets. 

3. How do I get started?
