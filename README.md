# FlatGUI

_A Qt C++ Library_

**Note:** I am currently reworking this repository. Some links might not be operational yet, nor have the complete nor the actual content. Please be patient!

## What is FlatGUI?

FlatGUI is an open-source library created to support the development of non-native looking graphical user interfaces for Qt widgets-based desktop applications. It servers as an extension to the Qtâ€™s functionality, providing a component development kit (CDK) for the creation of custom widgets, as well as a collection of ready-to-use components.

## Who might find FlatGUI useful?

If you are a die-hard fan of the Qt Widgets technology and QML is not your preferred language, though you still would like to create desktop applications with non-native looking graphical user interfaces, then FlatGUI is made just for you.

## How to use FlatGUI?

To use the FlatGUI you need the [Qt Library](https://www.qt.io/) and a C++ compiler for your platform.
